## PILLAR 1: REVENUE OPERATIONS (REVOPS)

### The Core Offer
* **Definition:** A "CTO-as-a-Service" for Sales Operations.
* **Problem Solved:** Prevents leads from being lost in the "Black Hole" of WhatsApp. Replaces manual chat with a structured Private Data Pipeline.
* **Ownership:** The client owns the infrastructure and the asset.

### The Technology Stack (The "Revenue Engine")
1.  **Interface:** Chatwoot Enterprise.
    * Function: Omnichannel Inbox (WhatsApp + Telegram).
    * Usage: Desktop & Mobile App for human agents.
2.  **Intelligence:** VeriRAG (Python).
    * Function: The "Brain."
    * Capability: Answers strictly from uploaded PDFs/Manuals.
    * Constraint: Zero Hallucinations (does not invent facts outside the provided documents).
3.  **Database:** EspoCRM ("The Vault").
    * Function: Single-Tenant customer relationship management.
    * Privacy: No shared databases with other clients.
4.  **Automation:** FastAPI ("The Hands").
    * Function: Auto-syncs data, detects intent, and updates CRM in real-time.

### Key Capabilities
* **Audio Intelligence:** * Transcribes incoming voice notes instantly.
    * Understands context and intent.
    * Responds to the client with an **audio voice message** (generated by AI), not just text.
    * Benefits: Searchable history (e.g., search for "budget" inside audio logs).
* **Structured Data Extraction:** * Extracts specific data points (Budget, Timeline, Intent) from natural conversation.
    * Automatically injects this data into EspoCRM fields.
* **VeriSync Live (Google Sheets Add-on):**
    * Connects the bot to a Google Sheet.
    * Allows for instant price updates: If a price changes in the Sheet, the bot quotes the new price immediately without needing to re-upload PDFs.

### Operational Rules (Fair Use)
* **AI Limits:** If a client exceeds their allocated AI message/audio limit, the bot stays active as a standard messaging channel for human agents, but automatic AI responses pause until the next cycle or top-up.
* **Knowledge Updates:** Clients can swap PDFs to update the AI's knowledge (e.g., new catalogs).

### The Core Offer
* **Definition:** Enterprise API Orchestration and Data Pipelines.

### The Technology Stack
1.  **MuleSoft & ESB:** Used for heavy-duty API management and connecting legacy systems (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce).
