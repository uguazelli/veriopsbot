### Evolution API

webhook for evolution api: http://veridata.bot:8080/evolution/webhook

Implemented the "Magic Words" logic and updated the Admin UI to show the bot's status for each user.

- To Pause: #stop, #human, #humano, etc.
- To Resume: #start, #bot, #iniciar, etc.

You can see the status (Active/Paused) in the Admin Sessions view.

This completes all your requests! The bot is ready to handle RAG, sessions, and human handover. Check the walkthrough for the full guide
